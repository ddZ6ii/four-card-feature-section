.cards-layout {
  grid-template-areas:
    'supervisor team-builder calculator'
    'supervisor karma        calculator';
  grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
  align-items: center;
  gap: var(--spacing-base);
}

#supervisor {
  grid-area: supervisor;
}
#team-builder {
  grid-area: team-builder;
}
#karma {
  grid-area: karma;
}
#calculator {
  grid-area: calculator;
